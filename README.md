Reflection
Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
I was able to achieve the main scope of the assigmnent, also iimplement some stech goals like ,use local storage to save and retrieve game data,Style the application excellently.
I used  my own API.


🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
-Yes, due to time contstraint , I would have love to add a user form to give each user a personalised experience.
- I had a bit of trouble importing images and audio from my public folder, by the time I recall the solution, it was a bit too late to add the images. but i did magned to add an audio.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I still have some issues writing JS up the top of  my head, I found myself going back and forth to class videos and demo which kind of make finhsing the assigmnet slower.
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:
I had a couple of errors when trying to return my counterpersecond so it shows on my page, After a couple of attempts I had to reach out to friends, which was handy.
